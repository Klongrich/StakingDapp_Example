# StakingDapp_Example


Small Demonstration of a staking dapp.

Live Demo:

# How it works: 

Every payout call there is 1,000 new MemCoins created.

If there is a total of 42,000 ETH staked in the contact and you have 1,337 ETH staked you would recive 31.48 MemCoins each payout call.

This is calculated by 1,337 / 42,000 = 0.03184 bp -> 0.03184 * 1,0000 = 31.48 MemCoins;

1,337 is about 3.184% of the total amount of ETH staked meaning you get that same percentage in MemCoins of the 1,0000 that are minted at the time 
of each payout call. You can also chose to withdwal your ETH at anytime.
