# StakingDapp_Example
Small Demonstration of a staking dapp. Production Env = truffle, ganache-cli, web3js, ReactJS &amp; Ropsten Test Net.

I have looked into openZeppelin and some other tools such as the remix IDE however, this is what I am famialr with building on so I stuck to that. I do however like openZeppelin's libs with access to ERC20 / ERC714 tokens. Along with the ability to spin up fast test networks and such.
